About
-----
TEXEngine is a small cross platform game engine.

Some of its features are:
 * LUA scripted UI
 * Procedural meshes and textures
 * Physics with Bullet
 * Audio with Fmod
 * Scene loading with our custom DSL scripting language (NCF)
 * CG shaders
 * Support for the XBOX360 controller

Supported platforms

Due to the NDA, we had to remove the PS3 source code
before releasing the engine as open-source.
